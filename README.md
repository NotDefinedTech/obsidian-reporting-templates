## Tracking and Reporting
Here's the simple system I have used at work to be able to quickly communicate my value throughout the year at reporting meetings, one-on-ones, and quarterly business reviews.

I use Obsidian, but the gist of these templates will likely translate well across many platforms.

Feel free to use and update as you see fit!

## Folder Structure
I have a folder for my daily notes (daily/) which is set in Obsidian as the default for creating a daily note.

I also created a folder called "review" and in that, I'll create the monthly, quarterly, and yearly files. 

Once the year is over, I create a folder with that year as the name inside of the review folder and then move all of the review files for that year into the folder.

I do this simply because it's less typing when first setting up the links to the files. For example, if I've created a new Quarterly file, I don't have to include the year in the path for each month. I just update `review/MONTH`. Obsidian has great link management especially when you move files or rename things inside of Obsidian, so once the year is over, moving that year's files into the year folder shouldn't break anything.
